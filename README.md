# Activity 3: Reflection

<strong>What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?</strong>

<p>
- I choose a plain and simple layout with a limited color palette to create a 
clean look.</p>

<strong>How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?</strong>
<p>
 -I used a clear font and ensured sufficient contrast between text and 
background colors. I also made sure that all interactive elements are 
easily tappable.</p>

<strong>What would you improve if this were a real app?</strong>
<p>
- I would add more interactive features, such as buttons for editing the 
profile or navigating to other sections of the app. I would also consider 
adding animations to enhance the user experience.</p>
